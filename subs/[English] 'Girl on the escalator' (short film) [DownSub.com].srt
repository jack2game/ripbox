1
00:00:02,572 --> 00:00:06,739
(escalator clicks)

2
2
00:00:20,806 --> 00:00:22,981
As I go toward the escalator,

3
3
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:26,731
a young fellow and a girl get on ahead of me.

4
4
00:00:30,479 --> 00:00:34,243
Her dress, her stockings, are skin tight.

5
5
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:36,782
She places one foot above the other

6
6
00:00:36,782 --> 00:00:37,873
upon the steps,

7
7
00:00:37,873 --> 00:00:42,084
and her behind assumes its position.

8
8
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:44,558
The young man looks all about.

9
9
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:46,193
He appears worried.

10
10
00:00:46,193 --> 00:00:47,669
He looks at me.

11
11
00:00:47,669 --> 00:00:50,841
I look away.

12
12
00:00:50,841 --> 00:00:53,452
No, you see I'm looking away.

13
13
00:00:53,452 --> 00:00:56,398
I am not looking at your girl's behind.

14
14
00:00:56,398 --> 00:00:59,407
Don't worry, I respect everything.

15
15
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:01,361
The flowers that grow.

16
16
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,689
The birds.
(birds chirp)

17
17
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:04,046
The sky.
(plane engine roars)

18
18
00:01:04,046 --> 00:01:06,348
The universe.

19
19
00:01:06,348 --> 00:01:09,437
I sense that the young man feels better,

20
20
00:01:09,437 --> 00:01:11,370
and I'm glad for him.

21
21
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,901
I know his problems.

22
22
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:16,078
The girl has a mother and a father,

23
23
00:01:16,078 --> 00:01:17,375
and maybe a brother,

24
24
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,926
and undoubtedly a bunch of relatives.

25
25
00:01:19,926 --> 00:01:22,195
She likes to dance and flirt,
(loud music blares)

26
26
00:01:22,195 --> 00:01:24,432
and she likes to go to movies.

27
27
00:01:24,432 --> 00:01:26,094
And sometimes she chews gum

28
28
00:01:26,094 --> 00:01:28,228
and talks at the same time.

29
29
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:31,807
And she enjoys the dumbest TV shows.

30
30
00:01:31,807 --> 00:01:34,003
And she thinks she's an actress.

31
31
00:01:34,003 --> 00:01:35,908
Goodbye Rick, God bless you.

32
32
00:01:35,908 --> 00:01:38,780
And she doesn't always look good.

33
33
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,027
And she has a terrible temper.
I hate you!

34
34
00:01:41,027 --> 00:01:44,670
And sometimes she goes crazy

35
35
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,750
and she can talk for hours on the telephone.

36
36
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,481
Oh my god, and that's an awful car.

37
37
00:01:50,481 --> 00:01:52,127
I told you not to.

38
38
00:01:52,127 --> 00:01:53,318
And she wants to go

39
39
00:01:53,318 --> 00:01:55,101
to Europe every summer.

40
40
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:57,711
And she wants to own a Mercedes.

41
41
00:01:57,711 --> 00:02:00,803
And she's in love with Mel Gibson.

42
42
00:02:00,803 --> 00:02:03,699
And her mother is a sneak drunk.

43
43
00:02:03,699 --> 00:02:06,638
And her father secretly hates blacks,

44
44
00:02:06,638 --> 00:02:08,529
browns, and yellows.

45
45
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:10,688
And she snores
(loud snoring)

46
46
00:02:10,688 --> 00:02:13,805
And is also cold in bed.
(man moaning)

47
47
00:02:13,805 --> 00:02:15,145
And she has a guru,

48
48
00:02:15,145 --> 00:02:19,488
a guy who met Christ in the desert in 1978.

49
49
00:02:19,488 --> 00:02:22,119
And she wants to be a skydiver.

50
50
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:25,087
And she's unemployed and gets migraine headaches

51
51
00:02:25,087 --> 00:02:29,841
every time she eats sugar, or cheese.

52
52
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:33,370
I watch him take her up the further escalator,

53
53
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,708
his arm protectively about her waist.

54
54
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,740
Thinking he's lucky.

55
55
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,321
Thinking he's macho.

56
56
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:42,560
Thinking that nobody in the world

57
57
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,734
has what he has, and he's right.

58
58
00:02:45,734 --> 00:02:48,144
Terribly, terribly right.

59
59
00:02:48,144 --> 00:02:51,196
Holding onto that batch of intestines,

60
60
00:02:51,196 --> 00:02:55,345
bladder, lungs, tetra zone

61
61
00:02:55,345 --> 00:02:57,428
flagellate protozoa

62
62
00:02:57,428 --> 00:03:01,520
sulfur, carbon dioxide, phelem, and phlegm.

63
63
00:03:06,075 --> 00:03:08,492
Lotsa luck.

64
64
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:14,399
