1
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,100
I do think about bipolar as part of who I am

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,320
It defines your outlooks at certain points

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,380
and just completely takes over

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,820
who you are and how you see things.

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,040
Hiya

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,240
Hello

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,480
I live in a three bedroom house in London

8
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,660
which is fortunate because it's cheap

9
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,520
and it’s the only way I can afford

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,280
to live in the city

11
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,640
We’ve turned our living room into a fourth bedroom

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,640
so we have no communal space

13
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,640
so I do everything in my bedroom

14
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,380
I watch TV on my laptop

15
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,600
I work, I sleep, I eat

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,780
I drink, I rest, everything.

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,840
It needs to be my haven

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,200
because it’s the only space I have

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,200
but there are large periods of time

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,780
where I just can’t look after it

21
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,480
and during that time it becomes the opposite

22
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,140
a hazard, a risk, a danger

23
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,760
and it just gets really messy

24
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,760
and I don’t know how it happens

25
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,760
and I never see it coming

26
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,760
but it just always, always does.

27
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,360
I suppose I sort of think about it

28
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,940
as if there are loads of different versions of me

29
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,500
the rational Ellice, which is the real one

30
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,640
and then the mania and the low

31
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,720
and then the extreme versions of those

32
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,720
and when you slip in to one or the other

33
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,800
you just lose sight of the rational.

34
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,880
It feels like weight

35
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,880
like my legs gain three stone

36
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,580
and it’s difficult to move when I want to.

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,360
It feels like a hand

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,940
pressing against my back

39
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,940
so I spend a lot of time

40
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,940
trying to stretch it out

41
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,940
but I can’t really do anything about it.

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,160
You don’t have the concentration and the focus

43
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,140
to really know that you’re in something at the time

44
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,700
to find the words to describe it.

45
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,100
And when you’re out of it it feels so alien.

46
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,100
It’s an extreme.

47
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,020
When you’re bipolar and you go really low

48
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,020
it’s nice to go high.

49
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,020
It’s just when it goes too far

50
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,020
and you can’t stop your hands from moving

51
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,640
and you can’t shut up and you can’t stop talking.

52
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,800
It can be horrid.

53
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,840
When I’m down it’s about my self worth

54
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,080
It’s asking me who I am?

55
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,020
What I'm doing?

56
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,200
What I’m doing with my life?

57
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,280
Just telling me that I’m shit

58
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,280
just pretty fucking shit.

59
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,640
It goes so quickly from one to the other

60
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,760
and there are days when I feel really good

61
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,900
and I have really high self esteem

62
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,340
and I feel like I’m just a normal person.

63
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,720
And then it’s only a day later

64
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,640
when I’ve properly stabled out

65
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,440
that I realise

66
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,920
I was being delusional.

67
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,420
I’ve been sat in a valley between

68
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,420
the rubbish and the clothes for weeks

69
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,420
just staring out at the mess.

70
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,080
Orange juice bottles, dried orange peel

71
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,680
wine bottles, sweet wrappers, crisp wrappers

72
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
just crap, crap, crap, crap.

73
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,720
I think it’s

74
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,720
a really dynamic thing

75
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,580
and it’s really subjective

76
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,160
so I don’t think there are really

77
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,720
stock things you can say about it.

78
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
And I’m still getting to grips with

79
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,300
how it manifests for me.

80
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,800
And the clothes at the end of my bed

81
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,360
a pile of dirty and clean.

82
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,460
I will sort through them

83
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,100
and I will reorganise them

84
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,100
and I will put them away so that for a while

85
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,800
it’s tidy and things will just be good for a bit.

86
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,460
I think you have to accept it

87
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,460
and accept everything knowing it will pass

88
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,460
and then most probably repeat

89
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,460
because that’s just the way

90
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,460
to be the kindest to yourself.
