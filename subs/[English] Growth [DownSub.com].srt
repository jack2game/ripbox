Growing older is
like a line

5
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,892
because it never stops

00:00:25,628 --> 00:00:27,982

It's actually changing,

7

actually changes.

It's funner seeing
the whole world

12
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:42,667

You get to explore
more things.

Almost.

months of her life,

25

do anything
on her own.

to her learning
to bicycle.

27

I'll just fall.

When she was first born,

44
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,161
She was kind of this blob that 
didn't really do much

45
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:11,714
Like she just kind of laid there
and cried and ate and pooped,

46
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:12,714
and that was it.

47
00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:14,282
All of a sudden,
it seemed like overnight,

48
00:02:14,282 --> 00:02:16,469

I feel like younger
siblings kind of grow up faster

older siblings are doing,

In fourth grade you
have to follow more directions,

you've got to hold to the things
that are true that matter most

00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,348
you probably wouldn't be getting divorced
in the first place,

169
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,349
(laughs)
right?

170
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,351
This one has a different
connector, doesn't it?

171
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,437
Ow! Head butt.

172
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:01,939
Go!

173
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,609
But, I think the
biggest challenge

174
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,609
is just the distance.

175
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,778
There's a lot of
chauffeuring back and forth

176
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:08,779
There we go!

177
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,284
(man)
I've had custody of her since
she was seven years old.

178
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,913
And I've always, um, wanted
to fufill her dreams.

179
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:21,083
Most people are so focused
on getting old

180
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,252
I wanna drive.
I wanna drink.

181
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,712
I wanna move out,

182
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:25,713
I wanna get away from you.

183
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,132
I wed my wife
to become young.

184
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,927
And I think it takes all your
life to become young.

185
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,096
So I think getting old,
and aging,

186
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,348
I'm not going to buy it.

187
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,518
(woman)
I feel like I'm
100 years old.

188
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,938
One, two, three,
four, five,

189
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:42,938
six, seven, eight,
nine, ten.

190
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:46,692
(woman)
They say most like he was
going to be blind and deaf

191
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,736
One, two, three,
four, five,

192
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,196
six, seven, eight,
nine, ten.

193
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,240
And they say he was
going to be mute,

194
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,616
based on the brain
damage the he has.

195
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,117
Give me your hand.
One, two, three,
four, five,

196
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,369
six, seven, eight,
nine, ten.

197
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,411
Okay, next.

198
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,454
I'm going to be
here for him.

199
00:08:58,829 --> 00:08:59,747
I'm his mom.

200
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,916
So there was not an option for
me to...

201
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,292
just, give up.

202
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,377
High thighs.

203
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,128
Ready?

204
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,296
(woman)
My mother -

205
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,924
she is optimistic
in a way

206
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,676
that's like, almost
annoying.

207
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,427
But actually,

208
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:16,013
I think it's the
thing that has
allowed me
to keep going,

209
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:21,477
when I really
didn't see any
way to go.

210
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,436
You out of water?

211
00:09:24,328 --> 00:09:25,328
Yes.

212
00:09:25,328 --> 00:09:26,328
Cold water.

213
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,615
(woman)
My mom was my compass
in my life.

214
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,868
As soon as I got
that phone call,

215
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:41,330
I feel like I aged 15 years.

216
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,250
I still walk out of a room, and
I'm gonna call my mom,

217
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,626
like, about to
dial her number,

218
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:46,877
and then it's like,

219
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,088
that reality of, like,

220
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,382
"oh you can never talk
to her again",

221
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,134
and you're really
on your own.

222
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,761
And that person that
has always been there,

223
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,346
and knows you the
best, and like,

224
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,048
loved you
unconditionally,

225
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:02,343
is no longer
in existence.

226
00:10:02,343 --> 00:10:04,312
(man reading in
foreign language)

227
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,439
(man)
Yes, I have
one daughter.

228
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,066
She's in her
forties now, uh,

229
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,235
I love her dearly.

230
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,863
I just - we don't have
much in common anymore.

231
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,574
So, I have to deal
with that.

232
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,494
And it's going to be
that way 'til the end

233
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:26,292
(singing)
Through a blueberry hill

234
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,548
(child)
I wanna get really old,
like an old man,

235
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,800
so I don't have
to go work,

236
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,720
and I can just sit down
and be lazy.

237
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,515
(man)
It's like, being a
grownup sounds final.

238
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,268
(laughs)
I don't want it
to end, you know?

239
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,811
I want to
keep growing.

240
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,521
Maybe I never
grew up.

241
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:51,901
I wanna put on my
tombstone, you know,

242
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,986
he's stayed alive
'til the end.

243
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:07,166
(man)
My father is in the
mid-stages of Alzheimer's.

244
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,918
I come home at night,

245
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,253
make sure the things are off,

246
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:14,757
TV's off, helping to
change his diaper.

247
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,718
I feel that he's turning into
that one-year-old.

248
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,012
And, life is very fragile.

249
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,557
You have to accept it.

250
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:31,107
I hope I will die in a very
uneventful way.

251
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,485
Every night, I come give my
father a kiss.

252
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,278
And I say goodnight to him.

253
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:43,369
And, knowing that, if he's gonna
die, I hope he dies this way.

254
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:57,842
(Elderly woman
speaking foreign language)

255
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,053
(woman)
Growing up is like,

256
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:46,432
your reflection in a mirror
becoming clearer,

257
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,224
and crisper,

258
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,893
as time goes by.

259
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,396
(woman)
It would be a slinky.

260
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,607
That's what growing up
is for me.

261
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,067
It can just sit there
in a stack,

262
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,612
until it's put
into motion.

263
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,530
And once it's
put into motion,

264
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,157
it flops over itself,

265
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,075
but it's
making progress.

266
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,619
So it's a
different experience

267
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,579
every time it contracts
and unfolds,

268
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,580
and contracts
and unfolds,

269
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,541
and does these leaps
on its journey.

270
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:17,880
(man)
Growing up is like
driving on the freeway

271
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,051
in that most of the time
you want to get through
it pretty quickly,

272
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,595
and most of the
time you don't.

273
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,973
But, at the end of the day,
you're probably going to get
to your destination.

274
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,269
(woman)
It's like somebody gave
me this huge atlas.

275
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,855
There aren't really any
instructions, like you're just
going to open this,

276
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,441
and maybe you're going to see
some things that you like.

277
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,528
And, maybe you're going to go
down the wrong path

278
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,154
and no one is really going
to stop you

279
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,823
and then when you get to the end
of that path,

280
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,242
you're going to figure out you
that you like, got something
out of it.

281
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:52,122
(woman)
To flower, that's my
idea of growth.

282
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,375
You come out
with yourself.

283
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,002
And I don't want you to
tell me what flower
you picked.

284
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,381
I want to witness
the flower you made.

285
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,592
(man)
You start learning
how to move

286
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,344
and you're like,
"oh, I think I got it,
I think I got it",

287
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,344
and then, uh,

288
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,930
and then you
get punched in the face.

289
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,976
Four months later, and you
learn how to throw out your
first combination,

290
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,728
and you get one jab in and
you get punched in the face.

291
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,772
As long as you can take
that punch,

292
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,400
and then you just realize,
ok, that was cool.

293
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,277
Let's keep going.

294
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,445
(woman)
I think that I would
pick a nautilus

295
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,906
I think that, they don't ever
really stop growing.

296
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,366
I don't think people ever really
stop growing up.

297
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,701
I don't think you're ever
really a grown up.

298
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,035
(girl)
Crazy but fun.

299
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,205
It's like a
rollercoaster, it takes
a lot of guts.

300
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,124
(woman)
It's the things you
can't quantify

301
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,084
(child)
It would probably
be a circle

302
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,837
(man)
It's a lot of things I find
now that I'm older
I keep revisiting.

303
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:40,462
(woman)
A metamorphosis.

304
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,922
(woman)
All encompassing
and round

305
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,507
(child)
Because it never stops.
